# Espanso Configuration Files

Espanso is a cross platform text expansion program written by Federico Terzi. Here's the link to the [website](https://espanso.org).

This repository is primarily to store my configuration file.

Included in my list of snippets:
- A variety of date substitutions
- A variety of signatures I use during the course of the day
- A collection of short email templates I use

There is also backup script I use to automatically save any changes to Github which is run once daily via a cron job.
